[Jocelyn](https://about.me/unaccomplished) works as a media entrepreneur, with a background in film, advertising, new media, and software development. She has had the pleasure of working with television brands such as [NBC](http://www.nbc.com/), [Fox](http://www.fox.com/), American Idol, [The Voice](http://www.nbc.com/the-voice/exclusives/app-s11), [America's Got Talent](http://www.nbc.com/americas-got-talent/exclusives/agt-app).  Jocelyn co-founded [Automaton Creative](http://automatoncreative.com/), a digital agency that produces videos and digital content for numerous tech start-ups, entertainment brands, and businesses.

She keeps it real by being an avid gamer & video connoisseur, cooking & devouring real food, swinging kettlebells, holding yoga poses, riding her bicycle in car-topia Los Angeles and spilling her guts on a blog.
